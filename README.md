## ConnectSafe System: 
Secure Communication Network Inspired by **Vehicle to Vehicle Communication (VANET)**,where users register on the System to participate in the network. This registration process ensures that only authorized vehicles can access the communication channels and exchange information.The system employs encryption techniques, such as **Blom's Scheme**, to establish secure communication channels between vehicles. Our demonstration showcases the system's resilience against potential attacks, offering users a firsthand experience of preventing malicious attempts to compromise Blom's Scheme encryption.In addition to showcasing the system's robust security features, our demonstration includes a simulated scenario to illustrate the importance of our security measures. Through this demonstration, users gain valuable insights into potential security threats and the effectiveness of our defenses. While we've designed the system to protect against such threats, the demonstration serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance in safeguarding sensitive data.
